  <p> Hi, My name is Jiya Mahalavat and I am a current high school junior. I aspire to be an AI engineer as I am very interested in AI, and want to dive deeper into all it has to offer. Outside of coding and learning, 
  I like to dance and constantly improve my skills. I am also a second degree black belt in taekwondo.</p>
  <p> I want to learn more coding skills and do more projects as that will help me enhance my technical skills but also help grow my soft skills. Problems at times can help people learn more about themselves
  and teach them more than they thought they would learn.</p>
  <p> My biggest core value would be dedication. No one in the world knows everything, and some things come easier to some than others. But, in the end it's about the ones who persevere and don't let
  obstacles hold them back. This is a very important core value for me as I know that dedication is key and something I abide by. </p>

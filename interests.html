    <strong>Coding:</strong>
    <p>Coding is really fascinating because there are so many things you can build. There are so many ways to solve a problem and it is really fun to see the end result.</p>

    <strong>Fashion:</strong>

    or in jewelry, hair, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tennis:</strong>
    <p>Every match in Tennis is unpredictable and that is what makes it so special. There is a lot of endurance-both physically and mentally required- which keeps the game interesting. </p>
